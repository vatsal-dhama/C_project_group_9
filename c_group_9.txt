AIM:
^^^ 
	
	Source format: 24-bit BMP
	Destination format: ICO

INSTRUCTIONS:
^^^^^^^^^^^^
	
	STEP_1: Unzip the folder Group_9.zip
	
	STEP_2: Navigate to the Group_9 directory in terminal
	
	STEP_3: Give the following command:
				
		    		-> make
		    
		    This will create a file by the name of "my_project"!
	
	STEP_4: Give the following command:
				
				-> ./my_project "source_file_name" "destination_file_name"
                                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
               				    (In .BMP Format)      (In .ICO Format)
             
			This code will create a file by the name of your inputed destination file name!
			You may open that file in appropriate image viewer to view it!

    	STEP_5: For converting another image, give the following command:

				-> make clean
		
			Now follow the STEP_1, STEP_2, STEP_3 and STEP_4!

WORK DISTRIBUTION: 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	
	 Although our whole project is the output of collective effort and collaboration of all the 
	 team members in every part of the project; but still for better organization of our project,
	 we divided our project into 4 parts: 
	
		A. BMP/ICO HEADERS (Core Contributers: Vatsal & Vaibhav):
		   
			-> Researched about BMP and ICO file formats. 
			-> Understood the creation and identification of BMP and ICO structures.
			-> Created bmp_header, dib_header, RGB, ImageData, ICONDIR, ICONDIRENTRY
			   and BitmapInfoHeader structures.
			-> Taught other teammates about BMP/ICO file format and provided them with various
			   resouces and references.
		
		B. READING BMP FILE (Core Contributer: Rahul):
			
			-> Researched about reading information from the BMP file.
			-> Created the read_bmp function.
			-> Implemented the reading of the inputted BMP file into the BMP header.

		C. WRITING ICO FILE (Core Contributer: Arhant and Prasanth):

			-> Researched about writing an ICO file.
			-> Researched about conversion of BMP to ICO.
			-> Created the code for the write_ico function.
			-> Implemented the conversion of BMP to ICO.

		D. MAKEFILE TEMPLATE (Core Contributer: Koushik):

			-> Studied the creation of MAKEFILE.
			-> Created the makefile.
			-> Implemented the final working of code with makefile.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
				-> Professor Srinivas and Professor Vivek under whose guidance we successfully implemented the project and the makefile.
				-> Professor Yashwant for teaaching the various theory concepts without which we couldn't have created our project.
				-> Ms. Janvi, our TA, for helping us wherever we were stuck.
